## List of Basic Linux Commands
Open up a Terminal in Linux. You can either use GUI to navigate to the terminal or use shortcut which is Ctrl+Alt+T in most distros to open the Terminal.

### ls - Lists directory contents.
If you run ls without any arguments, it lists the file in the present working directory. You can notice in this example ls output is color coded. All are blue here but there are other colors too.
```console
[wilcy@wilcy-pc ~]$ ls
 Desktop   Documents   Downloads  'Games Backup'   Music   Pictures   Public   Templates   Videos
```
"ls -l" displays the directories and files in a long listing format. We get more information about the files and directories displayed.
